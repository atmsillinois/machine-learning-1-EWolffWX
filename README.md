This code was completed as part of the ATMS 523 course for Module 5. The code, 
located in HW5.ipynb, uses multiple methods to fit a function for precipitation 
rate to radar variables and prints out r-squared and RMSE values for each 
methodology in order to evaluate.

Methods used include:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (with a grid search)
- Random Forest Regression (with a grid search)
